# ARM vs X86-64 vs RISC-V
- `x86` -> follows CISC CPU design
  - `CISC` -> Complex Instruction Set Computing
  - `closed ISA` Instruction Set Architecture -> Intel and Amd have license
  - complex instructions -> multiple instructions in a single statement
  - can `manipulate memory directly`

- `ARM` -> Advanced RISC Machine -> follows RISC CPU design
  - `RISC` -> Reduced Instructions Set Computing
  - `closed ISA` -> Arm limited has license 
  - simpler instruction set -> power efficiency
  - requires `seperate load and store instructions for memory manipulation`

- `RISC-V` -> follows RISC CPU design
  - `open ISA` -> no license needed
  - at the moment most relevant for embedded - but debian 13 will support it
